# Movie Tracker
![Production Site](https://themovietracker.herokuapp.com/)

Movie Tracker is a React.js/Redux.js app built with router and a Node.js/express back-end that pulls movie details from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). The app allows users to browse recently released movies and favorite individual movies. The favorite movies are saved to the user's dashboard.

My team of three members (including myself) built that app as part of a school project over one week.
